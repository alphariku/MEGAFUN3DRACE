# MEGA FUN RACE 3D!

This is Mega Fun Race 3D, the Technical test for Madbox ! This was made using Unity (2019.1.5f), based on the mobile game Fun Race 3D. The gamepay is similar : hold mouse click to move, and get to the end of the level dodging the deadly traps.
The game is best played at resolution 540x960.

This project was made in ~12h of work, in three days.
Getting back to Unity was troublesome at first, getting used to the software again. I started slowly, but as I kept coding I got my waypoints back and I could go a lot faster. I started from scratch, and created a prototype : A moving capsule along a railroad. From there I implemented in this order :

- Movement & Camera;
- Gravity & physics
- Death & Obstacles
- Animations of character and obstacles
- Level design
- UI
- Finishing touches and textures/lighting

The hardest part for me was the UI, and the animation controller, as I'd never done it before. Thankfully Unity's community is wide and I could find out how to do it pretty fast. I was alreadt used to scirpting and level designing/ animating, so this didn't pose any problem.

I've used an imported free asset from the store for the player and its animations, I know I'm very bad at that and I would've spent as much time on it as the whole project in my opinion !

What I could've done better is clear to me : making the game more fluid. Fluider animations and physics so that the games feels less like a prototype and more like an actual app. I thought I could have done better with the graphics but I did something so simple in the end that I came to like it, minimalist but still appealing. 

And If I could go a step further, I'd improve the level design a lot, like climbing up walls, strafing left and right, adding those kind of mechanics to make the game much more complete.

Thank you for reading me :D
